    Built with recycled plastic for a smaller environmental footprint.
    How It Works <br>
    <span style="color: blue; font-size: 22px;">System over view:</span> <br>
    Our aquaponics system combines fish and plants in a closed-loop ecosystem: <br>
    
    Fish Tank: Fish produce waste, which becomes nutrients for the plants. <br>
    Grow Bed: Plants absorb nutrients and clean the water. <br>
    Water Recirculation: Clean water is returned to the fish tank, creating a balanced cycle.
    Water Quality Parameters
    pH Level: <br>
    
    Ideal range: 6.5â€“7.5 for aquaponics systems. <br>
    The system automatically monitors and notifies you if adjustments are needed.
    Dissolved Oxygen (DO): <br>
    
    Crucial for healthy fish and plant growth. <br>
    The system ensures optimal oxygen levels by controlling aeration. <br>
    Temperature: <br>
    
    Maintains stable water temperatures suitable for your chosen fish and plants.</p>   </div>
